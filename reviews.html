                <blockquote><em class="quoteMark">&#8220; </em><em>Expedition Bloodshed</em> has plenty of suspense and terror, although we feel that it could benefit from doing away with the comedy scenes and focus only on scaring the living daylights out of viewers. However, we think that overall this film is worth the watch.<em class="quoteMark"> &#8221;</em></blockquote>

                <blockquote><em class="quoteMark">&#8220; </em>The first thing that will come to mind as you walk out of the theater will be 'Wow, I still can't believe that ending!'. The film does an excellent job toying with the mind, and is sure to leave you with just the right amount of confusion. No event in the story is how it first seems, least of all the ending, and that is something we hope to see in all future thrillers.<em class="quoteMark"> &#8221;</em></blockquote>
